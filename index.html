          Since the magic mirror will be used to contain general informaion, chances are that some designs would be bound to get in
          the way of the mirror's main purpose of being a mirror. Because of this all information given by the mirror must be put to the side
          to make room for the user's face to be seen.

          The program was created with p5.js. The clock was used by taking the time detected from the clock from the computer. 
          The weather information was taken from an api by Open-Meteo importing a free json that updates in real-time. The weather information includes
          the tempurature, the wind speed, and when the weather was last updated (which is usually every hour). The daily 
          schedule was taken from a csv file of my average schedule of tuesday/thursday. The same was done with the sleep schedule 
          as I was unable to find a json that would meet what I was looking for. The news information includes but not limited to the title of the story,
          the description of it, and the author/source of where the info came from. The news displays 2 stories that should update itself every 5 seconds 
          (depending on lag). I tried to grab the news from an api but it only works from a local host so i had to take the json from the site, download it, 
          and import it into the program manually; because of this the news taken are a few days old and not completely updated.
